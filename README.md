This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict photovoltaic (PV) energy output using weather forecasts. The model, built with XGBoost Regressor, outputs energy in kilowatt-hours on an hourly basis and incorporates features like solar declination, solar time, and wind components. I have successfully handled outliers, filled missing values, and performed feature engineering. Hyperparameter tuning improved the model, and further performance could be enhanced with additional data, such as a 5-year dataset split into 3 years for training and 2 for testing.
